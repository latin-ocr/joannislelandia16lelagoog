The Vicechancellor read the Qestions, and the Verses
which were written upon the same, and sent the Paper to
the King, and Seven Copies more to the greatest of the No·
bility. Then the Answerer read them over in like Sort, and
then made a Ihort Expofition of both the Qestion5‚ which
they calla Supposition, in which he spent a Qarter of an
Home or thereabouts. Then Dr. Holland replied Two
SyllogismS, and then animated his Son in 'One word, and
sett him to follow the Argument after him.' Five other
Dostots replied exceeding well, One in One Cause, and
another in another, every Man One Argument, which they
followed learnedly and well, and were as well answered
The Answerer ever repeated their Arguments clar-12 voce,

· that the whole Auditory might hear. The King was most

attentive, and would shew when he liked the Argument by
word, or other outward Gesture, One Argument was
grounded out of Verse of the Epistle of St. Jamoe,

dent, but the Opponent came to it again, by which Time

the Case upon the same, and then read the Second Question,
and another Case to the Purpo se, and so defired the An·
swerer to fhew his Minde, and how he would defend those
Qestions. The Answerer read the Qestions and the
Cases as the senior Opponent had done, and after made his
3 Congies to the King, and then begun, and ended within
One Qarter of an Home, as every Man did in every Fa·
culty, both they which answered‚ and they which replied
and determined. They all replied very well, and the Κίος
observed them much, and yet talked much to diverse about
him, but of a sudden 3 or 4 Times he spake, and interpreted

· the Law as he did to the Moderator Twice. He determined

One Qestion m this Manner, viz. R
egis·
