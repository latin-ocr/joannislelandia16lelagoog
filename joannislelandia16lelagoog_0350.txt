rer. 1 marvelled why the Bedells rode so far from the
Vicechancellor‚ and further from the King, the Proctors and
some others answered‚ they went before the University, and
feconffly, that their Chaucellor was there in Person.

This being done, he rode on untill he came unto St.
John’s College, where coming against the Gate, Three
young Youths in Habit and Attire like Nymphs confronted
him, representing England, Scotland, and behind, and talk-
ing Dialogue-wise each to other of their State, at last con·
clnded yielding up themselves to his gracious Governmenr,
The Scholars stood all on One Side of the Street, and the
Strangers of all Sorts on the other3 the Schollers stood first,
then the BatchelorS, and last the Masters of Arts. At Car·
fax the Greek Reader, standing in One of the Answerers
scats with a Desk before him, made an Oration iu Greek,
with good Aetion and Elocution and (as Dr. Hamond sayd)
in good familiar Greek. The King heard him willingly, and
,the Qeen much more, because she sayd‚ she never had heard
Greek. ·

From thence to Christ Church, where at the Hau Stairt.
Ροοτ, the Univerfity Orator made a good oration, only pre·
ferriug their Univerfity because the King oeme thither first,
and passed over all other Matters without Comparison.
Thence he went to the Church to solemn Prayers, at the
first Entrance when-eof, there was layd a fair Carpet with
CuslhionS, whereon the King and Qeen kneeled. Fron)
thence was carried over the King and Qeen a fair Canopy
of Crinison Taffety, by Six of the Canons of the Chnrch.
It was carried on Six Staves gilt with Silver, and on the
Topps great Silver Knobs and Pikes on the Topp of rheni.
The Edges were double, and double hanged and fringed
with red Silk3 the whole Society standing in their Surplices

on both Sides the middle All to the Qire Doore, where ·

the Dean of the Church p ented unto the Κίος certam
verses in Latin, and to the Qeen certain Verses in English.
So the King and Qeen proceeded to the upper End of the
Qire, where Places were provided for them behind the
Traverse. The Sex-vice was very solemn, the Qire fun,
and excellent Voiees, mixt with Instruments. When Prayers
were done, they came back in like Sort to the Doni-e, where
Six Footmen took the Canopy and carried it away for a Fee.
Then they went all to the King’s Lodging‚ and a while after
the Prinne accompanied with Three Coaches full of Noble-
men, and a Number of young Ones a Foot, went to Mag·
dalen College to his Lodging where he was entertained. 1t
