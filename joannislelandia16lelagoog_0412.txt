698 De Rebus Anglicanis Opustula Varia.

In confide-ration of all which .G1·ants‚ Royalties, Prin-’e-
leng, and Advauntags by th? Charter aforesaide, the same
Towne yerelie sstolde paie. by Force of the same Chanes, to
the Kings and Qeens, and their Succeffors of this Realme
of England‚ the Some of Twentie-fixe Pounds xiii·. iiij-¹.·
which yerelie Payment, by reason the Towne is so decayed
as aforeffaide, uppon humble Suite and Peticion made by the
same Inhabitaunts, towchinge the Mittigarion thereos, it
was graunted they ssxolde paie onfie for theire Fee Farms
but Thin-[eane PoundeS, Sixe Shinings, and Eight Pence,
until} suche Time as they were of better Habilitie. And {o
no more as yet they pale. Dyvers other Priveledgs and Com·
moditie3‚ ’by force of the same Charter, do belonge to the
same Towne, as by the same Charter more at large appear·
eth.

Nowe, Right Worsbipfull, it resteth accordinge to my
symple Skill to relate unto you by what Means the Teme,

- so decayed and de opulated, maie be newlie reedified and
floriffie, and the fubabitaunts thereof become ritche and
wealtbie, wherebie they maie be ahie as well to relieve them·
'selvqes as the Poore about them, which dailie encroese in great
Nombcr, to the great Charge of the Towne, and utter Ym-
poverifflement thereos if spendie Redress‘e be not fought for.
And therefore in the Behalf of the same Towne and the In·
habitaunts thereos, Ι profert to· your Worsswip's Considera·
tion the Premiffes here-after followinge, in which if your
Worship’ Will be Affistaunt, no doubt but in short T yme
the Towne will florishe, and the Inhabitaunts thereos growe to
Wealthe. And lastlic it will be greatlie beneficiali to your
Ἆότὼῐρ.

And First„ wheras your Worssfip by force of the Qeen's
Majestie’s Letters Pattents‚ have Libertie for the syndinge
and serchinge of all Mynes of Mettall, ὅτε. That your Wor·
ship wolde suffien- the same Mettals to be tried, and tran·
{posted onlie within and out of the same Towne, which in
Tyme will bringe great Trade, the Mynnes beinge fouude
profittablc‚ which 1 trust they will so prove.

Item, That your worship wolde take the Towne Liber·
τῖες and Fraunchises thereos in Fee Parme, for which the
›Tmue now -paeith by the Mittigaciou as aforesaide auin. vi⁸.
viiid Herein you might benefitt yourself,and noWhite hurt
the Towne‚ for they dQ no good with theire Charta, and
better it were for them to surrendcr it upp then kepe it.
And for that your Worfhip shall be certenlie perswaded‚ if
you charge yourself with the Fee Fax-me Rent of xiii& vi⁸.
