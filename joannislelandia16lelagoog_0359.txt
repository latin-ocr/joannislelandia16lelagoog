of his Coach, and walked about the Squere, viewed their
college, and commended the Garden within the square,
which at that Time was finely kept. From thence he went
by all Soules College where he heard an Oration, and from
thence to Magdalen College, and there heard an Oratim,

and from thence returned to Christ Church to Dinner, ·

where in Time of Dinner Dr. Lylly of Baliol College made
nuto him a learned Oration, but too long.

After the King had dined, there was posting to Horse;
at the Stairs Foot where the King entered into the Coun,
the Junior Prostor made a [hort Oration, and delivered it

with good Audacity. That done their Chancellor having ,

the Grant of the Perpetuity to the Univerfity for the Use
of the King's Reader, delivered it to his Majesty in a long

Box who took it in his Hand, and gave it to the Vicechan·‚

chellor, but sayd little or Nothing that 1 could learn3 only
he and the Qeen gave their Hands to be kirred of the Vice-
chancellor and the Rest of the Doaors, and bad them fare·
well and trouble themselves no further, who otherwise had
their Horses and Foot Clothes ready to have carried him out
of their Liberty. Then the King, Qeeu, and Prince went
all into One Coach, and passed through the Town, by
Magdalen College‚ not staying any where..

The Maior, and Twelve in Scarlet, with their Serjeant,
Town Clerlt, and 4 or 5 in black (who Ῑ think were Bay-
lies or such like Officers) rode before his Majesty through the
Town to the further End of the Bridge and there stopped.
‘Phe Maior carried the Mace as he did at his Majestie’s en·
tring. There were Verses sett upon the Walls of such Col·
leges as were in his Way, viz. All δουῐε, Corpus Christi,
and Magdalen, which the, King seemed not to see, or not
to regard, neither did a Man step out of the Train to view
or read any of them; so they were by the Boyes rudely
pulled down. The Scholers stood along by their CollegeS,
some orderly in their Hoods and Habits fit for their DegreeS,
some more' confusedly and disorderly without any such Re·

spen.
Other Things worthy to be observed.

‘rhe young 'Masters of Arts and Batchelors of Arts did
wear Gowns and Hoods so like, that they could not easily
be distinguished, viz. Black wide sseeved Gowns faced down
to the Foote with Taffaty, and about the Arme to turn up

to the Elboe, and black civili Hoods on their left Shomdeff}
